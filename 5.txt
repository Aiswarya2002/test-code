from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests 
URL = "webURL"
data = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(data.text, "html.parser")
imgs = soup.find_all('img') 
txt = soup.find_all('p) 


1. Crawling a website can be done using "bs4" and "requests".
2. First we use "requests" library to fetch the website we are going to crawl.
3. Then we use "BeautifulSoup" which is "bs4" using "html parser".
4. With help of "BeautifulSoup" we can extract all tags "img". 
5. Similarly, to extract the "Text" from the website we gonna use the tags like "p".
